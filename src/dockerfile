# Step 1: Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 2: Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Step 3: Copy the rest of the Angular project files
COPY . .

# Step 4: Build the Angular project
RUN npm run build --prod

# Step 5: Use Nginx to serve the Angular app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build artifacts from the previous stage to Nginx's public folder
COPY --from=build /app/dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose the port on which Nginx is running
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx when the container starts
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
